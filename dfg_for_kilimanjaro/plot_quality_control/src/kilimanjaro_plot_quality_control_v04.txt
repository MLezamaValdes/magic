IMPORTANT STATEMENT ON GEOID TRANSFORMATION
================================================================================
In the following checks, the transformation between WGS 1984 and ARC 1960 dates
is used. For this transformation, the "Arc_1960_To_WGS_1984" parameters with ID
1122 are used. The details are as follows:

Name                  ID    dx    dy  dz
Arc_1960_To_WGS_1984  1122  -160  -6  -302 

This date transformation is the one recommended for study regions stretching 
across Kenya and Tanzania and the default for transforming WGS 1984 to Arc 1960
for EPSG 21037 (i.e. UTM 37 S, Arc 1960) in the gdal library.

Please note that this is not the default behaviour of ArcGIS which uses
"Arc_1960_To_WGS_1984_2", ID 1284 (dx = -157, dy = -2, dz = -299) as default but
"Arc_1960_To_WGS_1984_2" is recommended for Kenya (onshore and offshore) only. 
For Tanzanian locations, the appropriate transformation would be
"Arc_1960_To_WGS_1984_3", ID 1285 (dx = -175, dy = -23, dz = -303) but since the
study area is located directly at the boarder, it is regarded as not sufficient.



IMPORTANT STATEMENT ON PLOT CENTRE DEFINITION
================================================================================
The plot centre is the metric centre of the bounding box of all B poles located
at a plot. Hence, it does not matter if the plot is divided into sub-plots or 
not. If it is devided, than it is still the centre of all (in that case 14) B 
poles. No exception from this rule.



QUALITY CHECK 1: EYE-BALL VERIFICATION OF ALL PLOTS REGARDING B-POLES
================================================================================
To check the general plot location, the position of the plot B-poles from the 
BPoles_ARC1960 data of the CP2 data set 11140, version from 2014-03-24 have been
overlaid on top of high resolution Microsoft bing aerial images and inspected
visually.


QC1: PREPROCESSING OF DATA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The basis for the GIS data set used within this check is the BPoles_ARC1960 
shape data of the CP2 data set 11140, version from 2014-03-24.

Procedure steps:
- GIS file has been imported by R using gdal
- GIS data has been transformed from its original projection in UTM 37 S, WGS84
  (EPSG: 32737) to lat/lon, WGS84 (EPSG 4326) using R's gdal library (sp)
- for each plot, an off-set of 0.01° is added to the bounding box of the B-poles 
  which has been computed from the actual shape file data (i.e. not the values
  listed in the attribute table)
- MS bing/OSM aerial imagery is downloaded for each plot's extend bounding box 
 (see previous step) from the openstreetmap API using R's openstreemap package
- the downloaded imagery is transformed from its original web Mercator
  projection (EPSG 3857) to UTM 37S, ARC 1960 (EPSG 21037) using R's gdal 
  library (sp)
- the B-Poles are also transformed from their original projection in UTM 37 S, 
  WGS84 EPSG: 32737) to UTM 37S, ARC 1960 (EPSG 21037) using R's gdal library 
  (sp)
- if the MS bing/OSM imagery is cloudy, respective imagery from Google has been
  processed (this applies only for a very limited number of plots):
    - Google aerial imagery is downloaded for each plot's extend bounding box 
      using R's ggmap package
    - as these images come in a geographic lat/lon, WGS84 system and not as
      spatial objects, the final pngs where created in this projection by 
      transforming the B-poles locations to lat/lon, WGS84 (EPSG 4326)
- the transformed imagery and B-poles locations are overlaid and stored as png
- each png has been manually inspected for the correct plot location with 
  respect to overall location in the landscape, orientation and completeness in
  the sense of 9 B-poles per plot.
For the check of the plot rotation, the GIS data set 11140 has been used.


QC1: NOTICEABLE PECULIARITIES AND RESULTING MODIFICATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The attributed names of following B-poles were not correct and have been 
modified:
- cof3-B3 (307710.3, 9642496,2) has been renamed to cof2-B3
- gar1-B4 has been renamed to gra1-B4
- hel4-B5 (319603.94, 9655466.6) has been renamed to hel3-B5

PLOT hom4: A, B and T poles have been rotated to 90°; C4/C14 have been moved
The A and B plot had to be rotated to an exact north-south/east-west orientation
with B1 to B3 directed to the east. The C plot is correct (although it looks not
like that; special case) except for C4 and C14 which have to be moved by ~25 m
in the respective direction.

PLOT hom5: A, B and T poles have been flipped
The A plot and the corresponding B poles 1 to 8 had to be rotated by 180°. B 
poles 9 to 14 are correct.

PLOT mai4: entire plot (A, B, T poles) has been rotated to 0°
The plot had to be rotated to an exact north-south/east-west orientation
with B1 to B3 directed to the north.

PLOT mai5: entire plot (A, B, T poles) has been rotated to 340°
The plot had to be rotated to a -20° north-south orientation
with B1 to B3 directed to the north-west.

PLOT sav5: entire plot (A, B, C, T poles) has been rotated to 270°
The plot had be rotated to an exact north-south/east-west orientation
with B1 to B3 directed to the west.

PLOT fpd4: entire plot (A, B, T poles) has been rotated to 140°
The plot had to be rotated to a 140° north-south orientation
with B1 to B3 directed to the south-east.

PLOT fer0: entire plot (A, B, T poles) has been rotated to 45°
The plot had to be rotated to a 45° north-south orientation
with B1 to B3 directed to the north-east.

PLOT fed2: Whittaker plot has been moved towards the far west
The A and B poles must be moved towards the west. The B poles and the plot 
centre will not change!



QUALITY CHECK 2: COMPARISON OF GPS DATA AGAINST DATA SET 11140
================================================================================
To check the plot location, the GPS-based coordinates of the plot centres
have been compared to (i) the AMiddlePole_ARC1960 data and (ii) the 
APoles_ARC1960 data of the CP2 data set 11140, version from 2014-03-24.

QC2: PREPROCESSING OF ORIGINAL GPS DATA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The basis for the GPS data set used within this bug fixing are the original
recorded values by A. Hemp and A. Ensslin who have used a UTM 37S, ARC 1960
projection (EPSG 21037).

Procedure steps:
- GPS coordinates have been exported from the GPS device to gpx files with
  a lat/lon, WGS84 (EPSG 4326) reference
- gpx files have been imported by R using gdal
- gpx data has been transformed from the automatically registered projection 
  (EPSG 4326) to UTM 37S, ARC 1960 (EPSG 21037) using R's gdal library (sp)
- "Name" tag of the gpx data set has been processed in order to separate the
  plot ids from the pole labels
- gpx data has been filtered to only include location records labled with "A"
  which indicates the centre of the respective (whitaker) plot
- final data set has been built using plot ids, easting and norhting information
As a result, a GPS-based data set containing plot ids as well as easting and 
northing coordinates of the plot centre (i.e. A pole) in UTM 37S, ARC 1960
(EPSG 21037) forms the basis for the comparison.


PREPROCESSING OF ORIGINAL "AMiddlePole_ARC1960" GIS DATA FROM DATASET 11140
One GIS data set used within this bug fixing is the AMiddlePole_ARC1960 shape 
data of the CP2 data set 11140, version from 2014-03-24.

Procedure steps:
- GIS file has been imported by R using gdal
- GIS data has been transformed from its original projection in UTM 37 S, WGS84
  (EPSG: 32737) to UTM 37S, ARC 1960 (EPSG 21037) using R's gdal library (sp)
- final data set has been built using plot ids and the easting/northing 
  information from the actual shape file (i.e. not the values listed in the 
  attribute table)
As a result, a GIS-based data set containing plot ids as well as easting and 
northing coordinates of the plot centre in UTM 37S, ARC 1960 (EPSG 21037) forms 
the basis for the comparison.


PREPROCESSING OF ORIGINAL "APoles_ARC1960" GIS DATA FROM DATASET 11140
Another GIS data set used within this bug fixing is the APoles_ARC1960 shape 
data of the CP2 data set 11140, version from 2014-03-24.

Procedure steps:
- GIS file has been imported by R using gdal
- GIS data has been transformed from its original projection in UTM 37 S, WGS84
  (EPSG: 32737) to UTM 37S, ARC 1960 (EPSG 21037) using R's gdal library (sp)
- plot centre has been computed using the mean of the bounding box extend in
  x and y direction; the bounding box has been computed from the actual shape file
  data (i.e. not the values listed in the attribute table).
- final data set has been built using plot ids and the computed easting/northing 
  information for the plot centre (see previous step)
As a result, a GIS-based data set containing plot ids as well as computed
easting and northing coordinates of the plot centre in UTM 37S, ARC 1960 
(EPSG 21037) forms the basis for the comparison.


QC2: COMPARISON OF THE GPS AND GIS DATA SETS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The comparison has been made between (i) the GPS and AMiddlePole_ARC1960 as well
as (ii) the GPS and APoles_ARC1960 GIS preprocessed data sets.

Procedure steps:
- the absolute difference between the X and Y locations of the GPS-based plot 
  centre and the information from AMiddlePole_ARC1960 has been computed
- the absolute differences have been filtered by a threshold value of 5 meters 
  to identify plots for which the location information of the two data sets 
  deviate by more than this range in X or Y direction
- the procedure steps above have been repeated for the APoles_ARC1960 GIS data 
  set

  
QC2: RESULTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following plots show a deviation (Delta*) between the GPS-based (GPS.*) and 
AMiddlePole_ARC1960-based (ID11140.AMP.*) location of more than 5 meter in X or 
Y direction:

The following plots show a deviation (Delta*) between the GPS-based (GPS.*) and 
APoles_ARC1960-based (ID11140.APC.*) centre location of more than 5 meter in X
or Y direction:

QC2: NOTICEABLE PECULIARITIES AND RESULTING MODIFICATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following comments are based on Table 1 and 2 as well as a visual inspection
of the different GPS and GIS data sets at the plots in question. Regarding the
GPS-based information, information on the location of all poles available in the
gpx files have also been considered (preprocessing has been performed analogous
to the procedure steps mentioned above except that not only the A-poles have
been filtered).

PLOT cof1 (as of Table 1 and Table 2): plot has been moved (dX ~ 9.3, dY ~ -5.4)
The GPS coordinates refer to the direct vicinity of Pole A4 in the GIS data set.
Since the GPS based centre is also centred with respect to the GPS-based
B-Poles it is very likely that the plot has to be moved by 9.385397 m towards E 
and 5.396083 towards S. The plot should has been moved in the GIS data set.

PLOT flm3 (as of Table 1): no modification
Although the deviation is slightly above 5 in Y direction, the visual inspection
of the geometry of the GPS-based poles and centre locations seems reasonable to 
the overall plot layout in the GIS dataset.

PLOT fpo2 (as of Table 1 and Table 2): no modification
This plot occurs two times in the GPS data set:
(1) The first occurrence with GPS coordinates 317605.6/9649455 is very likely
an optional plot which has been surveyed at the beginning of the research 
unit.
(2) The second occurrence with GPS coordinates 318014.8/9650699 is very likely 
the result of a mix-up with fp03 but the GIS-based location with fpo3 higher and
towards the east is correct. The same applies for fpo3, see below.

PLOT fpo3 (as of Table 1 and Table 2): no modification
The deviation of the GIS location is very likely the result of a mix-up with 
fpo2 but the GIS-based location with fpo2 lower and towards the west is correct.
The same applies for fpo2, see above.

PLOT cof5 (as of Table 2): plot centre pole has been moved
Since this plot is only shown in table two, the respective GPS- and GIS-based
centre coordinates are within a 5 m range (actually they are identical in this
case). The noticed deviation in table 2 results from the fact that the plot
is split into two sub-plots and the plot centre has been located in the more
eastern one. Within that eastern sub-plot, the centre is placed correctly
regarding the respective B poles. Regarding geo-statistical analysis the plot
centre should be moved to the centre of the overall bounding box of all B poles.

PLOT fer3 (as of Table 2): plot centre pole has been moved
Since this plot is only shown in table two, the respective GPS- and GIS-based
centre coordinates are within a 5 m range (actually they are identical in this
case). The noticed deviation in table 2 results from the fact that the plot
is split into two sub-plots and the plot centre has been located in the more
northern one. Within that northern sub-plot, the centre is placed correctly
regarding the respective B poles. Regarding geo-statistical analysis the plot
centre should be moved to the centre of the overall bounding box of all B poles.

PLOT hom5 (as of Table 2): plot centre pole has been moved
Since this plot is only shown in table two, the respective GPS- and GIS-based
centre coordinates are within a 5 m range (actually they are identical in this
case). The noticed deviation in table 2 results from the fact that the plot
is split into two sub-plots and the plot centre has been located in the more
eastern one. Within that eastern sub-plot, the centre is placed correctly
regarding the respective B poles. Regarding geo-statistical analysis the plot
centre should be moved to the centre of the overall bounding box of all B poles.

PLOT mai1 (as of Table 2): plot centre pole has been moved
Since this plot is only shown in table two, the respective GPS- and GIS-based
centre coordinates are within a 5 m range (actually they are identical in this
case). The noticed deviation in table 2 results from the fact that the centre
of the plot is (i) the centre with respect to the C poles (and not the B poles)
and (ii) that the Whittaker plot is in the south-western corner of the plot.
Hence, the plot centre should be moved to the centre of the B polygon.

Note on PLOT fed5 (not shown): no modification
This information is based on a comparison with the plot centre computed on the
basis of the A pole distribution in the GIS dataset. We mention it only in case
it will come up in a further discussion:
Since this plot is only shown in table two, the respective GPS- and GIS-based
centre coordinates are within a 5 m range (actually they are identical in this
case). The noticed deviation in table 2 results from the fact that the centre
of the plot is (i) the centre with respect to the B poles and (ii) that the 
Whittaker plot is moved towards the east. Hence, the centre is correctly located
within the B polygon.



IMPORTANT STATEMENT ON OTHER DATA SETS FOR PLOT INFORMATION
================================================================================
It is urgently demanded that data set "CP2_KiLi Research Plots_Arc1960_UTM" with
ID 10526 and the "Complete_Plots_midPoint_coordinates_update24032014.xlsx" Excel
file from the documentation section of the web page are deleted.

The Excel file has inconsistencies between its location informatino in lat/lon
and UTM 37S, ARC 1960 for plots sav2, kid1, kid2, nkw1, flm3. As compared to the
GIS-based CP2_KiLi Research Plots_Arc1960_UTM data set, the same is true for the
plots which are part of both data sets (i.e. all except kid* and nkw1).

The Excel file shows deviations of more than 5 m in X or Y direction for 20 
plots as compared to the GIS-based AMiddlePole_ARC1960 data set analysed above.

The GIS-Based CP2_KiLi Research Plots_Arc1960_UTM data set shows deviations of 
more than 5 m in X or Y direction for 23 plots as compared to the GIS-based 
AMiddlePole_ARC1960 data set analysed above.

Only one data set for the plot locations should be made available in the future.
This data set should be based on the updated data set 11140 which has been 
quality corrected within this update.
